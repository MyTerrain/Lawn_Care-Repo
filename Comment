# Comment on Improvement
- if you have any concern or comment to make about the coding or something that you feel the need to improve

    - I advise to attach your name on to the comment and the date
        Ex: John Doe Comment on large.html 
            //Why is file name "large.html"
            Suggestion: looking at the fuction, do you think naming it "Request" would be better
            [] Resolve
            [] Not resolve
* CODER/Programmer/Developer: Put an X inside either choice. If not you decide not to go with the suggestion, leave a comment as to why you think so. 1-2 short sentences is fine. 
        Ex: //Why is file name "large.html"

            [X] Resolve - Good Idea (Vince)
                    OR
            [X] Not resolve // It makes it easier for me.
